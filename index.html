<section id="About">
  <h2>About Me!</h2>
  <p class="p">Thanks for dropping by! My name is Joshua Horrocks and I'm a Web Developer. I started my technology education back in high school where I took a year long Java Script course, followed by a year of Python in college. I quickly came to realize, however, that I found it extremely frustrating to devout years of my life to getting a degree filled with unnecessary classes and hoops to jump through. So I decided to take a different approach. I enrolled in Lambda School in 2020 and began a more direct education.</p>
